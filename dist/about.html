            <div class="box box-1">
                <p>Iâ€™m an unorthodox developer. Like many computer nerds who grew up in the time before operating systems had beautiful pictures of serene lakes, snowy mountaintops, and virgin forests, I had to be creative to entertain myself when at startup there was only a lonely c colon backslash to greet you.
                So, after conquering the command line, I started digging deeper into the code. First, it was just simple batch files used to make sure all the school computers booted straight into Wolfenstein (this, BTW, was a problem that our computer teacher, not knowing that I was the one behind the problem, pulled me out of class to fix), and then more complex programs that required appeasing the syntax loving gods that ruled the C compiler.
                </p><p>But despite loving computers, I studied philosophy in college, because I also loved the humanities. Art. Literature. Politics. I was determined to be more than just your average nerd. Someone well balanced. And worldly. And at that time in life, I had little love for pleasing pendantic syntax gods. But after college (and briefly flirting with the idea of law school) I got back into programming. I started with Python. And I was genuinely surprised to find that I loved it more than I ever did as child. Perhaps, it was Python's simple syntax. Or maybe my tollerance for tedium had grown. 
                But I also found that philosophy lends itself more to computer science than one might think. In any logic class, you will run into George Boole and his truth tables, and Boolean algebra proved valuable later for the binary logic of the CPU. But philosophy made me a better programmer in a myriad of subtle and not so subtle ways. Like a disciplined approached to problem solving. And using abstraction as means to manage complexity. 
                </p><p>I don't know whether I am more than your average nerd. Or whether having labored through Kirkegaard made me more wordly. But I do know that when I returned to the subject of computer science after some time away from it that I was startled by how much I missed it, how happy programming makes me, and how much stronger a programmer I had become because of these other experiences.</p>
