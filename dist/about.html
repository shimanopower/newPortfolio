            <div class="box box-1">
                <p>Iâ€™m an unorthodox developer. Like many computer nerds who grew up in the time before operating systems had fancy GUIs and startup screens had beautiful pictures of serene lakes, snowy mountaintops, and virgin forests, I had to be creative to entertain myself when by default there was only C colon backslash.
                </p><p>So, after conquering MS-DOS, I started digging deeper by learning to code. First, it was just simple batch files to impress and annoy my elementary school classmates and teachers, and then more complex programs that required appeasing the syntax loving gods of the C compiler.
                </p><p>But despite loving computers, I studied philosophy in college. In high school, I fell in love with the humanities. Art. Literature. Politics. I was determined to be more than just your average nerd. Someone well balanced. And worldly. And at that time I had little love for pleasing pendantic syntax gods.
                </p><p>However, I found philosophy lends itself more to computer science than one might think. Anyone who studies formal logic will run into George Boole and his truth tables. Boolean algebra provided immense value for laying out the logic gates for our zeroes and ones. And what is philosophy if not the formal study of using abstraction as tool to manage complexity?
                </p><p>I don't know whether I am more than your average nerd. Or whether being able to tie together Foucault and the evolution of strings in Swift makes me more worldly. But I do know that when I returned to computer science after some time away from it that I was startled by how much I missed it, how happy programming makes me, and how much stronger a programmer I was because of these other experiences.</p>
