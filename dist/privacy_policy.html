            <div class="towcheck-info">
                    I built the Tow Check app as
                    a Commercial app. This SERVICE is provided by me,
                    Tristan Jackson  and is intended for
                    use as is.
                  </p> <p>
                    This page is used to inform visitors regarding
                    my policies with the collection, use, and
                    disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decided to use
                    my Service.
                  </p> <p>
                    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree
                    to the collection and use of information in relation to this
                    policy. The Personal Information that I collect is
                    used for providing and improving the Service.
                    I will not use or share your
                    information with anyone except as described in this Privacy
                    Policy.
                  </p> <p>
                    The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings
                    as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible at
                    Tow Check unless otherwise defined in this Privacy
                    Policy.
                  </p> <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p> <p>
                   This app collects absolutely nothing about you. The
                    information that I request will be retained on your device and is not collected by me in any way.
                  </p> <p>
                  </p> <p><strong>Security</strong></p> <p>
                    I value your trust in providing us
                    your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                    commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember
                    that no method of transmission over the internet, or method
                    of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and
                    I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                  </p> <p><strong>Third Party API</strong></p> <p>
                    Tow Check uses the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.orgChicago"> Chicago Data Portal </a>
                  </a>
                    which uses
                    the Socrata Open Data API to get data about
                    your towed car. From this some information might be collected 
                    about you. While I believe these are responsible parties,
                    I do not take any personal responsibility for how they collect
                    data. So I would advise you to contact them if it concerns you.
                  </p> <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p> <p>
                    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click
                    on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site.
                    Note that these external sites are not operated by
                    me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to
                    review the Privacy Policy of these websites.
                    I have no control over and assume no
                    responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or
                    practices of any third-party sites or services.
                  </p> <p><strong>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</strong></p> <p>
                    I do not knowingly collect personally
                    identifiable information from children under 13. If you
                    are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child
                    has provided us with personal information, please contact
                    me so that I will be able to do
                    necessary actions.
                  </p> <p><strong>Changes to This Privacy Policy</strong></p> <p>
                    I may update our Privacy Policy from
                    time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page
                    periodically for any changes. I will
                    notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy
                    on this page. These changes are effective immediately after
                    they are posted on this page.
                  </p> <p><strong>Contact Us</strong></p> <p>
                    If you have any questions or suggestions about
                    my Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact
                    me at mail@audreysmonsters.com.
